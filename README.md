# Alcovia Student App - Assignment

**Time limit:** 48 hours from when you receive this.

You're building screens for a student focus app, the API that powers them, and optionally an automation workflow. A design spec, starter code, and seed data are provided. What you build on top of them is your call.

---

## Core Requirements

Everyone must complete these. This is what you're evaluated on.

### 1. Mobile app (React Native / Expo)

| Screen | Spec level | What this means |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Dashboard | **Fully specced** | Design reference has exact measurements, colors, spacing. Match it closely. |
| History | **Partially specced** | Happy path is designed. Empty, loading, error, and pagination states are on you. |
| Session Detail | **No spec** | Tapping a session in History should go somewhere useful. Figure out what. |

### 2. Backend API (Express + SQLite)

The database schema, seed script, and fixture data are provided in `server/`. You build the route handlers for these endpoints (documented in `API-SPEC.md`):

- `GET /students/:id`
- `GET /students/:id/sessions` (with cursor-based pagination and filters)
- `GET /students/:id/sessions/:sessionId`
- `GET /students/:id/stats?period=week`

Pay attention to:
- Cursor-based pagination (not offset)
- The date format inconsistency between the sessions list and session detail endpoints (this is intentional, read the spec)
- Input validation and error handling

### 3. Documentation

- **DECISIONS.md** - fill in every section with your actual reasoning. This matters as much as the code.
- **Video demo** - 2-3 minute screen recording walking through your app. No narration required, but explain anything non-obvious.

---

## Bonus Challenges

These are optional. Complete any 2 or more and you're **guaranteed an interview**, regardless of how polished the core is.

### B1. Focus Timer
Build a Focus Timer screen accessible from the Dashboard's "Start Session" button. There is no design for this - you decide everything: timer UI, session type selection, pause/resume, and what happens when a session completes. Must POST to the `POST /students/:id/sessions` endpoint on completion.

### B2. Achievements Screen
Build the Achievements tab from the wireframe. You get the data shape and 12 achievement names. Everything visual is your decision: layout, locked vs unlocked treatment, progress visualization, animations. Must use `GET /students/:id/achievements`.

### B3. n8n Streak Workflow
When a student completes their daily goal (3 sessions), fire a webhook to an n8n workflow. Set up an n8n instance (local Docker or n8n.cloud free tier), create a workflow that does something useful with the notification, and make it idempotent (same student + same day = 1 notification). Payload documented in `API-SPEC.md`.

### B4. Tests
Write tests for your API. At minimum: pagination logic (cursor encoding/decoding, hasMore flag, edge cases) and the date format handling (epoch ms on list, ISO on detail).

### B5. Animations & Polish
Meaningful transitions between screens, skeleton loading states (not spinners), haptic feedback, or micro-interactions that make the app feel native.

## Getting started

```bash
# Mobile app
npm install
npx expo start

# Backend (separate terminal)
cd server
npm install
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

## How to submit

You'll receive a submission form link in the assignment email. You'll need:

1. Your GitHub repo link (public or invite @VibhorGautam)
2. Video demo link (Loom, Google Drive, or YouTube)
3. Which bonus challenges you completed

## What we're evaluating

We care about decisions more than polish. A thoughtful app with rough edges beats a pixel-perfect app that doesn't handle edge cases.

Specifically:
- How closely you match the design spec (Dashboard)
- How you handle states the spec doesn't cover (loading, empty, error, pagination)
- How you deal with the intentional API quirks (date formats, cursor pagination)
- The quality of your DECISIONS.md answers
- Code organization and TypeScript usage

## Rules

- You can use any libraries you want
- You can restructure the starter code however you see fit
- AI tools are fine to use, but your DECISIONS.md and video demo should reflect your own understanding
- If something in the spec seems wrong or ambiguous, make a call and document it in DECISIONS.md

## Implementation notes

**Stack:** Expo SDK 54 (Expo Router + React Native 0.81, React 19), TanStack Query (data/caching/pagination), react-native-reanimated 4 (UI-thread animations), react-native-svg (rings/charts), expo-haptics. Runs on iOS, Android, and web. Backend is Express + better-sqlite3.

**What's built:** all core screens (Dashboard, History, Session Detail) + all six endpoints, plus bonuses **B1 Focus Timer**, **B2 Achievements**, **B4 tests**, and **B5 animations/polish**. B3 (n8n) is intentionally not implemented. Also: a top-level error boundary, accessibility labels on interactive controls, and a server that auto-seeds when the DB is empty. Reasoning for every non-obvious choice is in `DECISIONS.md`.

**Layout:**
```
app/            screens (tabs, session/[id], timer) + error boundary in _layout
components/     ui/ (Screen, Card, Button, Text, ProgressRing, Skeleton, StateView,
                     AnimatedPressable, ErrorBoundary)
               + dashboard/ history/ achievements/ session/ timer/
lib/           api/ (client, queries, provider), format, haptics  (+ format.test.ts)
constants/     Colors, typography, sessionMeta
server/src/    app + routes/ + lib/ (errors, cursor, serialize, data, stats, time, validate)
server/tests/  jest: cursor + pagination + date-format contract
```

**Run it**
```bash
# Backend
cd server && npm install && npm run seed && npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
npm test                                                  # API tests (jest)

# App (separate terminal, from repo root)
npm install
npx expo start          # then press i / a for iOS / Android, or w for web
npx expo start --web    # web directly
npm test                # app unit tests (jest — format/date layer)
```
The app auto-detects the API host from the Expo dev server; override with `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` if needed. The server also auto-seeds on first run if the DB is empty, so `npm run seed` is optional (it's still the way to reset).

> Env note: on Node 24+ the starter's `better-sqlite3@11` won't compile — this repo bumps it to `^12`, which ships prebuilt binaries.
